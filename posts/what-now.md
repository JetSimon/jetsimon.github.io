Hey Jet-heads!

Last we spoke I had just canned DIY Tour. That is still a true statement. Surprisingly I actually got an email from someone who wished it hadn't been cancelled. As nice as that was to read (I was very touched), I think I made the right choice.

Honestly, I'm still getting my love for just creating games back. After working all day coding, it is harder than I thought to work on my own stuff. Who knew?!

But I have had time to work on a couple personal projects. I'm currently maintaining [a chrome extension I made for my brother and his history nerd friends to aid making Alternate Timeline Wikiboxes](https://github.com/JetSimon/wikibox-toolkit). That one's been pretty fun to work on.

Game development wise, I'm planning on doing a couple game jams soon. I think it'll be a good chance to just make something fast. Then I will try and prototype some game ideas I've had kicking around. If there's one thing I've learned it is this: YOU HAVE TO PROTOTYPE GAMES TO SEE IF THEY ARE FUN BEFORE YOU WORK ON THEM!

School is starting up soon and I can't wait to learn some linear algebra. Something about the matrix?

Thanks for reading,

Jet
