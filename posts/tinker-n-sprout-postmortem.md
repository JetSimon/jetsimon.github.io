Hello Jetizens, 

Last weekend I did a game jam for the first time this year. Yay! It felt very good to make something in a short period and finish it. 

The game I made is called [Tinker n' Sprout](https://simonjet.itch.io/tinker-n-sprout) (no, not *tinkle*). Since this game was for the [Multiplayer Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/multiplayer) it is a local co-op game. I was inspired by my recent rediscovery of Plants vs Zombies and made a tower defence game for two! One player (Tinker) places the towers (plants in this case) and avoids baddies, and the other (Sprout) uses the mouse to buy, plant, and grow plants to send to Tinker through a pipe.

I think it turned out well for what it is. It hasn't been recieved too crazily yet, but I'm happy I finished it. Here is a break down of what I think went well, and what could be better.

## The Good

* I am very happy with how the art style turned out. Originally I was going to do pixel art, but frankly, I'm tired of pixel art. If I have to draw another 16 x 16 pokemon inspired player character I may just lose it!
* I think the core concept is really cool. I like how it feels to send things through a pipe to another player.
* I am proud of the music.
* I like how the main menu teaches the player (though a tutorial level would be better - more on that later).
* I used a lot of fancy new programming skills I learned from my Summer internship at Unity. Actions, lambdas, properties, templates, oh my!

## The Bad

* I should have went with a few smaller levels than one bigger level. The bigger level feels repetetive and tiring, and makes the game seem harder to new players.
* Enemy pathfinding would be good to have, because then if I made other levels I would be able to add obstacles to those levels to switch it up. I think that would take the game to another level.
* The difficulty curve is too easy. This was a surprise to me because usually I make things too hard for players. Oh well.

I may revisit this in the future. I like the concept and I think a Tinker n' Sprout: Deluxe Edition with levels would be the perfect scope for a small Steam release. Something to think about.

Thanks for reading,

Jet
