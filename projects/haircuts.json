        "Simple game mechanics with good polish and feel create a great player experience!",
        "Implementing the haircut judging system was pretty interesting to fine tune. Had to weight certain variables more than others (for example a lack of hair where a customer wants hair is judged more harshly than leaving a chunk of hair)",
        "Built in tutorials are the best way to teach a player. They will not want to read your descriptoin to find out how to play!",
        "It was very useful to pick the somewhat messy and cartoonish art style. It made producing assets fast and fun!"
